[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

> **Exercise 2**   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
>Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?  

>> Looks good.  The PMF looks fairly uniform.
